# Course-Project-2-for-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

Fine particulate matter (PM_{2.5}) is an ambient air pollutant for which thereis strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. 
In the United States, theEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambientair quality standards for fine
PM and for tracking the emissions of thispollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases itsdatabase on
emissions of PM_{2.5}. This database is known as the NationalEmissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI 
at the[[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html][EPA National Emissions Inventory web site]].

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons ofPM_{2.5} were emitted from that source 
over the course of the entire year. Thedata that we use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and2008. 
The data is available [[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%252Fdata%252FNEI_data.zip][here]].

* Goal
The overall goal is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about 
fine particulate matter pollution in the United states overthe 10-year period 1999-2008.

* Questions
- Have total emissions from PM_{2.5} decreased in the United States from 1999 to  2008?

- Have total emissions from PM_{2.5} decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland  from 1999 to 2008?

- Of the four types of sources indicated by the =type= (point, nonpoint, onroad,  nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in  emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in  emissions from 1999-2008?

- Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related  sources changed from 1999-2008?

- How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in  Baltimore City?

- Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions  from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has  seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
